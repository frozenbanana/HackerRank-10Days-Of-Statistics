# The manager of a industrial plant is planning to buy a machine of either type A or type B. For each dayâ€™s operation:
# The number of repairs, X, that machine A needs is a Poisson random variable with mean 0.88.
# The daily cost of operating  is Ca = 160 + 40*X^2.
# The number of repairs, X, that machine B needs is a Poisson random variable with mean 1.55.
# The daily cost of operating  is Cb = 128 + 40*Y^2.
# Assume that the repairs take a negligible amount of time and the machines are maintained nightly to ensure
# that they operate like new at the start of each day. Find and print the expected daily cost for each machine.
# Print expected daily cost of machine A and B
